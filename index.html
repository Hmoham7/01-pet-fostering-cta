      <h2>Why Foster Pets?</h2>
      <p>Fostering provides temporary homes for animals waiting for adoption. It helps socialize them, reduces shelter overcrowding, and gives you the joy of caring for pets. Many fosters become lifelong pet owners! Benefits include building compassion, teaching responsibility, and making a real impact on animal welfare.</p>
